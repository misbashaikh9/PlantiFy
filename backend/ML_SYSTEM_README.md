- **Continuous Updates**: Improves with user feedback

## 📊 Using the ML System

### **In Guided AI Chat:**
The ML system is automatically integrated into the guided AI chat. When users answer questions, the system:

1. **Collects Information**: Gathers plant details through guided questions
2. **ML Analysis**: Runs predictions using trained models
3. **Intelligent Responses**: Provides personalized, data-driven advice
4. **Learning**: Stores user feedback for model improvement

### **Direct API Usage:**
```python
from ml_plant_care_system import get_ml_system

ml = get_ml_system()

# Predict care success
care_result = ml.predict_care_success({
    "plant_type": "Monstera",
    "environment": "indoor",
    "light_level": "bright_indirect",
    "humidity": "high",
    "temperature": "warm",
    "soil_type": "well_draining",
    "watering_frequency": "weekly",
    "fertilizer_frequency": "monthly"
})

# Diagnose disease
disease_result = ml.diagnose_disease("yellow leaves, wilting", {
    "plant_type": "Monstera",
    "environment": "indoor",
    "care_history": "overwatering"
})

# Get fertilizer recommendation
fertilizer_result = ml.recommend_fertilizer({
    "plant_type": "Monstera",
    "season": "spring",
    "soil_type": "well_draining",
    "plant_age": "mature",
    "growth_rate": "active"
})
```

## 🔄 Continuous Learning

### **User Feedback Integration:**
```python
# Add user feedback for model improvement
ml.add_user_feedback({
    "plant_type": "Monstera",
    "care_routine": "weekly watering, monthly fertilizer",
    "outcome": "plant thrived",
    "user_rating": 5
})
```

### **Automatic Retraining:**
- Models retrain every 10 new feedback entries
- Improves accuracy over time
- Adapts to user preferences and local conditions
